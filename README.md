# Chrome-Extension
We usually forget the passwords for different sites.
Chrome saves passowrds but it saves according to username.

This extension helps you save password once filled. 
Next time when you need to login, you can click on the icon again to prefill your username and password.
Thus you no more have to remember long passwords for different sites.
